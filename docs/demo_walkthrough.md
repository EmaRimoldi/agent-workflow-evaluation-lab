# Demo Walkthrough

This repository is easiest to read as an evidence trail, not as a UI demo.
The concrete task is AutoResearch: agents edit one CIFAR-10 training script,
run evaluations, and try to reduce validation loss.

## The Task

`autoresearch/` is the benchmark substrate used by the runtime:

- `autoresearch/train.py` is the file agents are allowed to edit.
- `autoresearch/prepare.py` owns data loading and evaluation.
- `val_bpb` is the reported validation-loss proxy; lower is better.
- Agent modes differ only in how search is coordinated: single long run,
  parallel independent runs, private/shared memory, swarm blackboard, or merge.

This gives the repo a concrete experimental question:

> Which agent workflow finds better `train.py` edits per unit of wall time,
> cost, and coordination overhead?

## Fastest Reading Path

1. Read the selected benchmark baseline:
   [`studies/baseline/README.md`](../studies/baseline/README.md).

   The current baseline was chosen after 161 controlled non-agentic evaluations.
   The selected starting model is "width 30, lower learning rate" (internal ID
   `width30_lr_low`), with `val_bpb = 0.841354` and future agent target
   `target_val_bpb = 0.824`.

2. Read the strongest agent-workflow finding:
   [`studies/agent_memory_ablation/README.md`](../studies/agent_memory_ablation/README.md).

   The most informative comparison is P11 vs P12:

   | Probe | Meaning | Runs | Best `val_bpb` | Mean `val_bpb` |
   |---|---|---:|---:|---:|
   | P11 | high-temperature exploration, no memory | 21 | 0.934 | 1.816 |
   | P12 | high-temperature exploration with shared memory | 41 | 0.914 | 1.049 |

   The interpretation is that exploration without routing correction behaves
   like a random walk, while shared memory reduces catastrophic repeats.

3. Read why the task had to be calibrated:
   [`studies/evaluator_calibration/results/evaluator_calibration_summary.md`](../studies/evaluator_calibration/results/evaluator_calibration_summary.md).

   This study made evaluation deterministic. Five consecutive baseline runs
   produced identical `val_bpb = 0.811222`, which means differences can be
   attributed to agent edits rather than training noise.

4. Read why compute allocation had to be controlled:
   [`studies/compute_allocation_calibration/README.md`](../studies/compute_allocation_calibration/README.md).

   This study shows why fixed-time parallel training can look worse simply
   because each worker completes fewer optimizer updates, and why fixed-step
   evaluation separates quality from latency.
