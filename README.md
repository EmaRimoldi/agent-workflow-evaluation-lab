# AgentOps Lab

AgentOps Lab is a research-grade framework for measuring when AI agent systems
should run as a single agent, parallel agents, coordinated swarms, or post-hoc
merge workflows.

The goal is practical: make agentic workflows auditable before they are trusted
with expensive or long-running work. The repo focuses on reliability,
evaluation, cost, wall-clock time, coordination, and reproducibility.

## Why This Exists

Most agent demos answer "can an agent do the task?" AgentOps Lab asks harder
operational questions:

- Does parallelization improve quality, or only spend more tokens?
- When does swarm communication create signal instead of coordination overhead?
- Which workflow reaches a target quality threshold fastest?
- What is the cost to hit a reviewer-defined quality level?
- Are improvements caused by better search, better coordination, or evaluator
  noise?
- Can an agent run be replayed, inspected, and defended?

## Core Capabilities

| Capability | What it provides |
|---|---|
| Mode comparison | `single_long`, `parallel`, `swarm`, and `merge` execution surfaces |
| Swarm coordination | Shared JSONL blackboard, claims, deduplication, global-best tracking |
| Certified time | `T_wall` and `T_cost` hitting-time analysis from run logs |
| Baseline headroom | Calibration before confirmatory experiments so easy baselines do not dominate |
| Diversity metrics | `H_prior` / `H_post` style prompt, trajectory, and weight-space diversity |
| Reproducible substrate | CPU-oriented AutoResearch task with deterministic fixed-step evaluation |
| Operational traces | Snapshots, reasoning traces, training run logs, collector/reporting pipeline |

## Install

```bash
uv sync --dev
```

Run tests:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python -m pytest tests -q
```

## CLI

Canonical public surface:

```bash
uv run agentic --help
uv run agentic parallel --help
uv run agentic single-long --help
uv run agentic swarm --help
uv run agentic merge --help
```

Compatibility entrypoints remain available while runtime ownership moves fully
under `agentic_systems`:

```bash
uv run run-parallel --help
uv run run-single-long --help
uv run run-imported-swarm --help
uv run analyze-certified-time --help
uv run calibrate-baseline-headroom --help
```

## Public Package Surface

The preferred import path is `agentic_systems`.

```text
agentic_systems/
  cli.py
  config.py
  orchestrator.py
  communication/
    blackboard.py
    coordinator.py
  analysis/
    diversity.py
  instrumentation/
    snapshotting.py
    reasoning_trace.py
    certified_time.py
  modes/
    parallel.py
    single_long.py
    swarm.py
    merge.py
```

The compatibility implementation remains under `agent_parallelization_new`
during this public-release phase because it is the currently tested runtime for
launching, collection, reporting, merge, baseline calibration, and certified
time workflows.

## Research Frame

AgentOps Lab evaluates agentic systems through a decomposition of improvement:

```math
\Delta = \log(\kappa_0 / \kappa) + \phi + G - \epsilon
```

where the terms separate cost/search efficiency, parallel or coordination
effects, gains, and estimator/error penalties. The current empirical substrate
uses a deterministic CPU optimization task with fixed-step evaluation, mode
labeling, calibration gates, and post-hoc decomposition analysis.

## Release Profile

This tree is intended as a clean public showcase release. Historical provenance,
legacy imports, and prompt/task-process history are excluded from this export
profile while the tested runtime, evaluation docs, experiment summaries, and
source code remain available.
